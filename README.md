# The Phone
The **Qin F21 Pro** is a half-touchscreen, half-button phone running **Android 11**. It features:
- **2.8-inch 640 x 480px IPS capacitive touchscreen**
- **5MP rear camera** with a **2MP front camera**
- **GSM networks:** 850/900/1800/1900MHz
- **4G network support**

The device is available in different configurations.



---



# Versions
### Hardware versions
There are **two main hardware versions** of the phone:
- **64+4GB version**
- **32+3GB version**

The phone also varies in **color**:
- White
- Black

Additionally, it has different **keyboard languages**:
- English
- Russian
- Hebrew

### Software versions
The phone comes with at least three different ROM versions:
- **Original Factory ROM:** Chinese + English, bootloader locked, no Google Play.
- **Hacked Version:** Chinese + English, bootloader unlocked, Google Play present, supposedly Google certified.
- **International ROM:** Multi-language support, bootloader unlocked, Google Play present, NOT Google certified.

#### **Privacy concerns**
These stock ROMs are not to be trusted as they send suspicious packets directly to China.
Some of them were sent to NTP servers in China which isn't that strange but others point to duoqin.com, miui.com and others.
A list of all URLs that are/ can be sent information:
  - connect.rom.miui.com
  - wifi.vivo.com.cn
  - connectivitycheck.platform.hicloud.com
  - cn.ntp.org.cn
  - dq-avatar.duoqin.com
  - loc.map.baidu.com
<ins>At least that's what PCAPdroid reported</ins>. I used it with root access so it should see literally everything sent from the device. I hope thats the case.
The privacy topic will be discussed more later in this document.

### Differences
There should be no difference between the 64 and 32 versions, their ROMs are compatible with each other.
In case there are problems, it is only a problem due to the size of the partitions - usually in the userdata partition, replace it with the userdata partition from the ROM that worked for you and it should work

### Custom ROMs
 There are also some custom ROMs for this phone.
 Currently, we're developing a lineageos 21 (android 14) based ROM\
 fot the qin f21 pro. Go check it out in the discord server!\
 It's still in development but there's a lot of progress!

# Hardware Modes
The phone can be booted into several modes, all of which require the device to be **TURNED OFF**.

### **Normal Mode**
Entered by pressing the **power button** for a few seconds until the logo appears.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd88e24c-d9e9-4881-8113-91b7e388cf6f" width="200">

---

### **Recovery Mode**
Entered by holding down the following buttons:
- **Owl/Heart/Qinguard button**
- **Power/Hangup button**
- **`*` (Star) button**

Once the **boot menu** appears, **release the power button but continue holding the other two buttons**. If you keep holding the power button, the phone will simply reboot.

Alternatively, you can enter this mode using:
```sh
adb reboot bootloader
```

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85496ee0-80f1-4552-ac21-1b2465d80fcf" width="200">

After entering Recovery Mode, you will see this screen:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51cc821b-59e7-48a0-a0bd-fc692de65811" width="200">

To enter the menu, **hold down the power/hangup button and press the up button on the "joystick"**:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c80d086b-f327-4733-b43a-26f6bcef1f44" width="200">

You will then see this menu:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/243b470e-849d-4587-ae87-5ba379ebf61d" width="200">

#### **Navigation**
- Use the **joystick buttons** to navigate.
- Use the **power button** to select.

#### **Recovery Menu Options**
- **Reboot to system now:** Reboots into normal mode.
- **Reboot to bootloader:** Reboots into fastboot mode.
- **Enter fastboot:** Enters fastbootd mode with options to reboot, return to recovery, enter fastboot, or power off. This mode can also be accessed via:```adb reboot fastboot```.
- **Apply update from ADB:** Untested.
- **Apply update from SD card:** Untested (the phone lacks an SD card slot).
- **Wipe data/factory reset:** Wipes all user data (**likely works, but untested**).
- **Mount /system:** Displays "Mounted /system." at the bottom, but its usefulness is unclear.
- **View recovery logs:** Displays logs from recovery mode.
- **Run graphics test:** Displays a test of multiple images, including the broken Android "No Command" image and data-clearing animation.
- **Run locale test:** Shows different language versions of system texts such as "No Command," "Installing," and "Erasing."
- **Power off:** Reboots the device (instead of powering it down).

This mode could be useful, but I am not sure exactly how. It **can** be used to enter **fastboot mode**, which is very useful for flashing and modifications.

---

### **Fastboot/Bootloader Mode**
Fastboot mode can be entered in multiple ways:
- From the **Recovery Menu** (as mentioned above)
- Using ADB:
  ```sh
  adb reboot bootloader
  ```
- Using **MTKClient payloads**:
  ```sh
  python mtk payload --metamode FASTBOOT
  ```
  *(This did not work for me, but it is reported to work)*

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2637828-6242-426c-b2c8-bc555096ebe2" width="200">

#### **Fastboot Commands**
Fastboot mode is used for flashing firmware, unlocking the bootloader, and checking/modifying partitions.
- **Check current slot:**
  ```sh
  fastboot getvar current-slot
  ```
- **Check all information from fastboot:**
  ```sh
  fastboot getvar all
  ```
- **Change active slot:**
  ```sh
  fastboot set_active a
  fastboot set_active b
  ```
  
  ---

### **Preloader mode**
  It is used in mtkclient or spflash tool.\
  When using these 2 tools, you might want to put the phone in this mode.\
  To do this, simply connect the phone to your computer with a USB cable when the tool is running without pressing any keys.\
  This should put the phone in preloader mode.

  The view from mtkclient:
  
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20b574fd-3f11-4afe-ac0e-2ebb3a4fed44" width="300">

  This mode together with these tools can be used to dump the rom, make backups, flash the rom and many other things.
  
---
  
### **BROM (bootrom) mode**
  It is used in mtkclient or spflash tool.\
  When using these 2 tools, you might want to put the phone in this mode.\
  To do this, hold the Owl/Heart/Qinguard button and back button and connect the device to your computer, while mtkclient or spflashtool is running.

# Hardware

## Keypad and buttons
#### The phone has a total of **21 buttons**.
This includes:
   - ```0-9``` number buttons,
   - ```*``` and ```#``` buttons,
   - A call button,
   - A power / hangup button,
   - A ```go back``` button,
   - 4 directional buttons (up, down, left and right),
   - Middle / select button,
   - A weird owl/heart/qinguard button.


 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/657c2fd0-0e87-4509-8cf4-34966d7cd6a4" width="250">

### Interesting facts about the keypad:
- Pressing the **4, 7,** keys at the same time gives the same keycode as the back button.\
  This is probably caused by how the keyboard distinguishes buttons.\
  It's done either by a row-column matrix or by having **different resistances** for each key.\
  It could mean that the 3 keys' resistances add up to be the same as the back button's resistance.
  
<br>

- When experimenting with settings in the stock locked ROM, I was very interested in the "Quick Settings" tab.\
  It is responsible for selecting hotkeys for different actions such as vol+, vol-, opening an app, speed dial, flashlight, or opening any other app.\
  The action is invoked when a chosen button is held for a moment.

  The first important thing to note is that **the hotkeys only work with the default launcher**.\
  I am using a custom open-source minimalist launcher which can be found [here](https://github.com/DroidWorksStudio/EasyLauncher).
     
  So, these hotkeys don't work with my launcher **EXCEPT** for vol+ and vol-!\
  I later discovered that the value of the button for these two actions is stored in the global table as:
  ```
  volume_down_shotcut_keycode
  ```
  *Note: that is not a spelling mistake, it's **shotcut** and not **shortcut***
  
  This isn't the case for any other actions. Their "shotcut keycodes" aren't stored in the settings.\
  Instead they could be stored in the launchers data.
  
  All of this suggests that:
     - **vol+ and vol-** are handled by the **system itself**.
     - **The rest** are handled by the **default launcher**


  The value of the setting changes depending on which key we choose.\
  The system settings allow us to choose **only number keys**.\
  We can try to go around this.
  
<br>

  #### I started tweaking with ADB and testing different values.
  Soon, i came up with this key map.
  
  
      "<3"    : none
      "4"    : back button
      "5"    : call button
      "6"    : none
      "7"    : 0 number key
      "8"    : 1 number key
      "9"    : 2 number key
      "10"   : 3 number key
      "11"   : 4 number key
      "12"   : 5 number key
      "13"   : 6 number key
      "14"   : 7 number key
      "15"   : 8 number key
      "16"   : 9 number key
      "17"   : *
      "18"   : #
      "19"   : up
      "20"   : down
      "21"   : left
      "22"   : right
      "23"   : middle/ select
      ">24"   : none

  To get the current value, use
  ```
  adb shell settings get global volume_down_shotcut_keycode
  ```
  And to change the value:
  ```
  adb shell settings put global volume_down_shotcut_keycode 16
  ```
  These are example commands, change them to your needs.
      
  This key map **can** be useful if you use the stock rom and want to set your volume keys to any of the buttons...\
  Well, except for the power button... and the **Owl/Heart/Qinguard button** 🤔\
  It turns out that at least to my knowledge these two cannot be mapped to do these actions.\
  While it makes sense with the power button, since it has a crucial role of powering on and off...\
  The other one doesn't.
<br>
  Anyway, if you want to have cool shortcuts, please use [this KeyMapper](https://github.com/keymapperorg/KeyMapper) app.\
  It is free, open source and works great.\
  It allows for a lot more tweaking and also supports the **Owl/Heart/Qinguard button**.

<br>

- It turns out the **Owl/Heart/Qinguard button** is handled differently than the other keys.\
  When you connect your phone to a computer and run:
   ```
  adb shell getevent -lq
   ```
  it will output the events occuring in the device.\
  When you press most of the buttons, you get an output like this:
  
      In this case **button 1** pressed:
         ```/dev/input/event0: EV_KEY       KEY_1                DOWN                
            /dev/input/event0: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000            
            /dev/input/event0: EV_KEY       KEY_1                UP                  
            /dev/input/event0: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000
         ```
         When the **power button** is pressed:
         ```
            /dev/input/event1: EV_KEY       KEY_POWER            DOWN                
            /dev/input/event1: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000            
            /dev/input/event1: EV_KEY       KEY_POWER            UP                  
            /dev/input/event1: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000
         ```
         And when the **Owl/Heart/Qinguard button**
         ```
            /dev/input/event3: EV_KEY       KEY_MENU             DOWN                
            /dev/input/event3: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000            
            /dev/input/event3: EV_KEY       KEY_MENU             UP                  
            /dev/input/event3: EV_SYN       SYN_REPORT           00000000
         ```
  
  Notice how the /dev/input/event**X** differs depending on the keys.\
  From this we know that the **power button** and the **Owl/Heart/Qinguard button** are both handled differently than the rest.
  That's a little strange.

# Software
The software on the phone may vary. What I present here is based on the **Original Factory ROM** Build number 2.3.6, which is the newest as of March 2025.  
It contains a lot of bloatware and possibly spyware. Some of it can be removed **without root**, while removing others **does require root**.  
Some system apps **can** be deleted and the phone will still function, while others **cannot** be removed!

### Preinstalled Apps
A list of apps installed by default that aren't part of Android or MTK apps:

```
- com.baidu.map.location         : NetworkLocation          /system/app/Baidu_Location/Baidu_Location.apk
- com.duoqin.inputmethod         : Voice input method       /system/priv-app/VoiceInput/VoiceInput.apk
- com.duoqin.inputmethod.pinyin  : (Chinese characters)     /system/app/DuoqinIme/DuoqinIme.apk  
- com.duoqin.pinyin              : Keypad input method      /system/app/DuoqinIme_new/DuoqinIme_new.apk
- com.duoqin.promarket           : App Market               /system/priv-app/Market/Market.apk   
- com.duoqin.qweather            : Weather                  /system/app/Weather/Weather.apk
- com.duoqin.remoteservice       : Duoqin Remote Service    /system/priv-app/RemoteService/RemoteService.apk  
- com.duoqin.syncassistant       : Sync Assistant           /system/app/Baidu_Location/Baidu_Location.apk
- com.duoqin.translator          : Duoqin Translator        /system/app/Translator/Translator.apk
- com.iqqijni.dv12key            : 12Key-Keyboard           /system/app/KikaIME/KikaIME.apk
- com.wapi.wapicertmanager       : WAPI certificate         /system/priv-app/WapiCertManager/WapiCertManager.apk
```

#### Be Careful When Removing!
Most of this is useless and can be removed with the device still booting **EXCEPT FOR THE WEATHER APP!**\
When you remove the weather app, after rebooting your phone will fail to run SystemUI, essentially\
making it a brick and you'll need to install a backup. Don't remove the weather app!

# Hacking the Device

## Before You Start
Now that you know a lot of technical details about the system, you can try to hack it. There are many things you can do, but no matter what you try, **you should be very careful**, as everything past this point **<ins>may</ins> lead to you bricking your device**. All the information given by me was gathered by my research and the work of many other people. Using this information i succeeded in hacking this phone but I cannot guarantee that you will succeed.

Before doing **anything**, you must make a backup of your original ROM. This could be **very useful** if you accidentally brick your device.
> **DO YOUR BACKUPS AND KEEP THEM SAFE!**

---

## Making a Full Backup

### Requirements
To make a full device backup, you will need [mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient). I will be using **mtkclient GUI**. It's a tool used for:
- Exploitation
- Reading/Writing flash
- Unlocking/Locking the bootloader
- And more

I **will not go into details on how to install it**. You can find installation guides on the internet. You will also need to install the necessary drivers.\
**NOT FOR MAC USERS: you should use the "alternative method" described below, using the live iso it more reliable on mac!**

#### Alternative Method
If you do not want to install everything manually, you can use this **[ready-to-use ISO file](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=15664248565197184488)**:
1. Burn the ISO onto a flash drive or use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html).
2. Boot from the USB drive.
3. Select **Boot Live System**.
4. After booting, you will see **mtkclient GUI** on the desktop. This is what I used mostly.
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8697a9f8-c64c-4d28-8930-8165ca1b9615" width="300">

<br>

### Either way, you need to run **mtkclient GUI**!

<br>

### Steps to Make a Backup
1. Run **mtkclient GUI**.
2. Power off your device and connect it in **[BROM mode](#brom-bootrom-mode)**. Alternatively, you can try to do the same in [preloader mode](#preloader-mode).
   - To enter BROM mode, follow [this guide](#brom-bootrom-mode).
   - If successful, you should see a confirmation message.
     
     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6b7e5ef-7db0-4b38-9b40-26b05f0f6661" width="300">
        
   - If not, check:
     - Your cable
     - Your connection
     - Whether you have the correct drivers installed
     - If the USB device is recognized at all


3. Proceed with the backup:
   - Open the **Read partition(s)** tab.
   - Click **Select all partitions**.
   - You <ins>can</ins> unselect **userdata** from the list:
     - This partition contains user data. If your phone is factory reset, there is no need to back this up.
     - If your phone is not factory reset and you want to keep your data, leave the box checked.
     - However, be aware that **userdata is encrypted**.
     - If the decryption keys are lost (their location is unknown to me), you may not be able to decrypt it later, resulting in data loss.
     - If you are flashing other ROMs, assume you will lose userdata.
   - Enable **Dump GPT**.
   - Press **Read Partition(s)** and select a safe place to store the backup.
   - Click **OK** and wait for the process to complete.

     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca80eec-4827-429b-9ba9-ec3a00ba5556" width="300">

> **DO NOT touch anything, move the cable, or interrupt the process!**
 4. When it says its **done** you should have a bunch of files in the directory you chose\
     Again, **keep them safe**
5. Now, we will backup the **Preloader**\
    I am not yet sure if this is essential but it doesn't hurt to backup it anyway\
    If you backup it, you might then **unbrick your device easier** so it is worth it
   - Open the **Flash Tools** tab.
   - Click **Read preloader**
   - Select a safe place to store it.
     - I like to rename it from ```boot1.bin``` to ```[preloader]boot1.bin```
6. Success! You should now have an entire system backup\
   It can be reflashed later in case of a brick or you wanting to go back to its original ROM\
   To reflash use the **Write Partition(s)** tab

     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b332f5f-9d1f-45c0-82c4-28bf610d63da" width="600">

   Note: in step 3. you could also use the option **Read flash** from the **Flash Tools** tab to read the whole flash (?)


---


## Unpacking the original ROM
It's possible to unpack the original ROM provided by the manufacturer.\
I did this by first [doing a backup](#making-a-full-backup) (rom dump).\
This left me with a folder with many .bin files:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b332f5f-9d1f-45c0-82c4-28bf610d63da" width="800">

**Here's the list of them, explained briefly (I skipped A/B versions like boot_a.bin and boot_b.bin as they are usually copies)**

```
boot_a.bin:                        These partitions contain the boot image, including the kernel and ramdisk, essential for booting the device.
boot_para.bin:                     Would likely store boot parameters or configuration data but is empty.​
dtbo_a.bin:                        Contains the Device Tree Blob Overlay, which provides hardware configuration data to the kernel.
expdb.bin:                         Seems to contain some boot logs.
flashinfo.bin:                     May hold information about the flash storage but is mostly empty
frp.bin:                           Should store Factory Reset Protection data but is almost empty.
gpt_backup.bin / gpt.bin:          These files represent the GUID Partition Table (GPT) and its backup, defining the partition layout on the storage device.​
gz_a.bin:                          Could be related to the 'gz' partition, possibly containing the Gzip-compressed kernel. For me it is completely empty though.
lk_a.bin:                          Contains the Little Kernel bootloader, responsible for initializing hardware and starting the main kernel.

Current-slot value stored in para.bin

**For me the most interesting files will be these though:**
   - boot_a.bin
   - super.bin
   - lk_a.bin
   - logo.bin

I will try to unpack each of them and then maybe try to modify later.

## boot_a.bin
This file contains the **boot image** including the **kernel** and the **ramdisk**.\
We can unpack it using the amazing [Android Image Kitchen](https://xdaforums.com/t/tool-android-image-kitchen-unpack-repack-kernel-ramdisk-win-android-linux-mac.2073775/).\
When we have the Android Image Kitchen ready, simply **drag and drop** your **boot_a.bin** onto **unpackimg.bat**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/731e9d06-5fb9-4a1e-b715-7eecc1a6fa36)

We will now have 2 new folders:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22263e74-4754-4537-98d8-52eefaa3ba46)

The **split_img** folder contains the **boot_a.bin** individual parts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34456fa9-109c-4845-aef3-1097054c6f5f)

The most interesting files are **boot_a.bin-kernel** and **boot_a.bin-ramdisk.cpio.gz**\
The first one, of course is the **kernel** and contains just binary data.\
The second one contains the **ramdisk** and can be <ins>opened</ins>.\
But <ins> this </ins> was already done for us and the ramdisk contents are already in the **ramdisk** folder.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c20fe1a4-5f5a-420a-8c20-9b961ba5f3b5)

Folders that are empty were marked with **red**.\
They are mostly folders that will be **mountpoints**,\
or will contain **processes, devices etc** when the system is running.

Folders that are marked with **green** contain various files.
These include:
   - libraries
   - binaries
   - fstab configs
   - init files
   - images
   - others

## Rooting
To root the device you will need to **patch the boot image**.\
Before doing that, you need to know **which slot is active**. For this you will need **fastboot** installed\
Note: This tutorial is based on [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-xiaomi-qin-f21-pro-mt6761-global-rooted-with-play-store.4425811/) tutorial, my experience and research and other info on [XDA Forums](https://xdaforums.com/).

**The steps needed to root the phone:**
1. **Boot into** [fastboot](#fastbootbootloader-mode) using the information [here](#fastbootbootloader-mode).
2. **Connect to a computer with fastboot installed** and run:
   ```
   fastboot getvar current-slot
   ```
   - This will output either slot ```a``` or slot ```b```.
   - Remember which one it is.
     
3. **Go into your ROM backup.** If you haven't done it, [do it now](#making-a-full-backup)!
   - Find the following file: ```boot_a.bin``` or ```boot_b.bin``` **depending on which slot was active**.
   - ```boot_a.bin``` for slot a active and ```boot_b.bin``` for slot b active.

4. **Copy that file** to the phone's internal memory by connecting it with a cable to your computer or by ```adb push```
   - Put it somewhere that you will find later.
   - It's the file that you will patch with magisk.

5. **Download Magisk** [latest .apk file](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases) 
    - It should be named app-release.apk
    - You also need to copy this file to your phone's internal memory

6. **Install Magisk app** from the .apk file you put in your memory
   - For this you will need to find it in file explorer and click on it and install.
   - If you cannot install it, you might need to put it in **/Internal shared storage/Android/obb** folder
   - If you still cannot install the app, you will need to find help online.

7. **Open the Magisk app** once installed and patch the boot image
   - You should see an **Install** button. Click it.
   - Now, you will have to select the ```boot_a.bin``` or ```boot_b.bin``` file from before.
   - Once selected click **LET'S GO ->**. It will now proceed to patch the boot image.
   - The patched image should be saved somewhere in the phone's memory, usually in **/Internal shared storage/Downloads**.
   - The exact location should be printed out (it's cut off in the screenshot but you can swipe to see it).
     
     <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7f9a83-36a4-40ff-afe4-a533367a7765" width="300">

8. **Copy the patched boot image** back to your computer using a cable or ```adb pull```
   - This file will need to be flashed as **boot_a** or **boot_b** partition using mtkclient.
   - For this, you need to copy it from the device to the computer.
   - **You should change the file extension to .bin** so that mtkclient recognizes it.

9. **Run mtkclient gui and unlock the bootloader**
   - Power off your device and connect it in BROM mode to mtclient.
   - If you don't know how to enter BROM mode, follow [this guide](#brom-bootrom-mode).
   - Go into the **Flashing** tab and press **Unlock Bootloader**
   - This should unlock your phone's bootloader.

10. **Download [this vbmeta](https://github.com/AlikornSause/Notes-on-QIN-F21-PRO/blob/main/vbmeta_a.bin) file**
    - This file is needed to enable booting the patched image.
    - It comes from [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-xiaomi-qin-f21-pro-mt6761-global-rooted-with-play-store.4425811/post-88203539) post from XDA Forums. The author of the post, @-gloim- claims that the file comes from [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-xiaomi-qin-f21-pro-custom-firmware-root-playstore-certified.4405615/) tutorial.
    - This file solved this issue appearing on the screen:
      ```
      dm-verity corruption
      Your device is corrupt.
      It can't be trusted and may not work properly
      Press power button to continue.
      Or, device will power off in 5s
      ```
      I think it's caused by the bootloader not accepting the boot image, because it can't verify it.
    - Some people suggested that flashing an empty file instead of this vbmeta file works but **I can't advise that, as it didn't work for me**
    - It did not work for me because it probably didn't even flash the file. The mtkclient gui kept freezing when flashing an empty file.
    - It seems like the empty file is not accepted, causing the process to freeze.
    - Someone might have found a solution to that. He used this command to flash the empty file:
      ```fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_a vbmeta_a.bin```
      
    - It may have worked for him but **I did not use that method. I just used [the file](https://github.com/AlikornSause/Notes-on-QIN-F21-PRO/blob/main/vbmeta_a.bin) i provided above** and thats what I advise everyone to do
    
11. **Flash the patched boot image and vbmeta file**
    - Open the **Write Partition(s)** tab.
    - Find **boot_a** or **boot_b** (depending on your **active slot**) in the list.
    - Click **Set** next to the **boot_a** or **boot_b** and select your magisk patched image.
    - Find **vbmeta_a** or **vbmeta_b** in this list.
    - Click **Set** next to the **vbmeta_a** or **vbmeta_b** (depending on your **active slot**) and select [the vbmeta file](https://github.com/AlikornSause/Notes-on-QIN-F21-PRO/blob/main/vbmeta_a.bin) you downloaded earlier.
    - **MAKE SURE NO OTHER PARTITION IS SELECTED!**
    - Click **Write partition** and let it do its thing
   
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f414421-bad4-4652-b5e8-09e28aba5845)


> **DO NOT touch anything, move the cable, or interrupt the process!**

12. **When it says its done, unplug your phone**.
    - The process should now be done!

13. **Power your device up**
    - You should see an **Orange state warning**. This is **normal**. It means the bootloader is unlocked.\
      [NOTE: some googled devices seem to not show this message]
    - The message should not be worrying. The phone will boot in 5 seconds.
    - The message can also be [changed](#changing-the-orange-state-warning-text) or [removed](#removing-the-orange-state-warning-text).
    - The 5 second delay can also be [removed](#removing-the-5-second-delay-in-orange-state).

14. **Your phone should now be rooted!**
    - After powering on, launch the magisk app. You should see a screen similar to this:

      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccc552ff-64b5-456c-b2d8-ac1d2148c825" width="300">

## Modifying the /system partition
**BE CAREFUL!** When editing the /system partition you can delete crucial system files and brick your device!
<br><br>
If your device is already rooted you can edit anything on the /system partition.\

The steps to do this:
1. You need to get a root shell. This can be done through a terminal app or through adb.
   - If you want to use a terminal app you will need to grant superuser permission when using it.\
     To do this, simply open up a command line [(termux)](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) or something similar and type in:
     ```
     su
     ```
     This will prompt for superuser permission if you have working magisk root. Grant this permission.\
     Now you have a root shell on your device. This can be seen as a **#** at the end of your command prompt instead of a **$**
     
   - If you want to use adb, run:
     ```
     adb shell
     su
     ```
     You will probably be also prompted for superuser permission. **It might also require enabling adb root access in magisk settings**.\
     Now you have a root shell using adb. This can be seen as a **#** at the end of your command prompt instead of a **$**
     
     Note: This is **NOT** the same as doing ```adb root```, which is only available on test builds and would require some tweaking to work on this device

2. Remount the /system partition:
   ```
   mount -o rw,remount /
   ```
   This will make the /system partition writable.
   
3. You can modify anything as long **as you are root**. After a reboot you will need to remount it again\
   **BE CAREFUL!** When editing the /system partition you can delete crucial system files and brick your device!

## Debloating
There are multiple ways to debloat the system or delete the apps:
### **Disabling Some of the Apps**
It's not possible to uninstall the bloatware, but you can disable some of the apps in the settings. You can also strip them of background data permissions and other permissions, but they will technically still be there. This **does not** require root but isn't very effective.

### **Uninstalling the Apps with a Debloater**
You can uninstall all the apps **if your phone is rooted** using a system app remover/debloater like [this one](https://github.com/sunilpaulmathew/De-Bloater).\
**I do not recommend using this method though!**\
For me it didn't work for some of the apps and they stayed even though it said they were gone.\
And knowing that you **need root for this**, you can use a different method.\
I recommend using [the last method](#manually-removing-apps).

### **Uninstalling the Apps with ADB**
<ins>Note: this method doesn't work!</ins>
On a normal Android device, you could uninstall system apps like this:
```
adb shell
su
pm uninstall -k --user 0 <package-name>
```
This does not work for this phone, though 🙂. Whenever any `pm` command is sent, it just says:
```
Failure
```
It seems like the `pm` command was deliberately modified by the manufacturer to not work. Either way, this method **would require root**.

### **Manually Removing Apps**
Disclaimer:\
Doing this **can brick your device**!\
Before deleting an app, **be absolute sure** that you can delete it!\
Some apps can be safely deleted while others cannot!\
You might delete an app responsible for a critical system service!
This might **brick your device** or in some cases **cause a bootloop**!
Make sure to [have a backup](#making-a-full-backup)!

You can remove apps from the filesystem if your phone is rooted.\
For example:
```
adb shell
su
rm /system/path/to/an/app -r
```
You would need to first find the path, but this way, the app will literally cease to exist.\
This is my preferred method 🙂. Of course, you will **need root** for this.

## Changing the Orange State Warning text
**You might be annoyed by this text that appears when booting:**
```
Orange State
Your device has been unlocked and can't be trusted
Your device will boot in 5 seconds
```
[NOTE: some googled devices seem to not show this message]

You can change it to say something else.

**The steps to change the text:**
1. **Go into your ROM backup.** If you haven't done it, [do it now](#making-a-full-backup)!
   - Find the following file: ```lk_a.bin``` or ```lk_b.bin``` **depending on which slot is active**.
   - **LK** stands for **Little Kernel** and is a kind of bootloader.
     
2. **Open the file with a hex editor** like [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
   - We will need to edit the file as hex information
     
3. **Find the string**
   - Do a text search for **"orange"** or **"state"**.
   - You will probably see a couple of strings containing the word **"orange"** but you need to find the one with the whole string.
   - It should look like this:
     
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac62515e-c21c-4e28-8b25-a27abb9777fa)

4. **Edit the string**
   - Now you can edit the string **BUT BE VERY CAREFUL!**.
   - You **shouldn't add** any text but **overwrite** the text to be displayed that's already in there.
   - It should look something like this.
     
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbca998f-463e-4090-8b92-ccb0e69922d6)

   - Notice how I zeroed the rest of the text area and didn't put spaces in there.
   - Make sure you **don't** put 0 as a character because it will display 0's on the screen.
   - Make sure you **don't** put spaces in there.
   - Put ```00```'s in **HEX** and **not** "0"s as characters!

5. **MAKE SURE you didn't overwrite anything**
   - You have to be sure that you didn't overwrite anything that was in there.
   - You can **only overwrite the text that would be displayed**.
   - Make sure the text you put there together with the ```00's``` isn't longer than the original text.
   - **You really shouldn't overwrite anything other than the text displayed!**
     
6. **Save the file somewhere else as lk.bin**
   - Make sure **not to overwrite your backup file!**
     
7. **Flash the file**
   - Flash the file to either ```lk_a``` or ```lk_b``` partitions **depending on which slot is active**
   - You should do the flashing the same way as in [here](#rooting) point 11 using mtkclient.
   - Again, **make sure you only overwrite the lk_a or lk_b**.
     
8. **Reboot**
   - If done correctly, the text should change as expected 🙂.
   - This can also be used to change other strings.
   - This includes the **Red state** warning and other warnings.
   - The process should be very similar although **I haven't tested that**.
   - But always, be **very carefull** when modifying these files.

**If the device behaves strangely, you might have made an error when editing, try to reflash the original backup of lk**
---
## Removing the Orange State Warning text
**You might me annoyed by this text that appears when booting:**
```
Orange State
Your device has been unlocked and can't be trusted
Your device will boot in 5 seconds
```
You can remove it the same way as editing it [here](#changing-the-orange-state-warning-text).
You will just need to put ```00's``` in place of all of the characters.
This should look like this.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81b220f4-4862-47d9-b9a8-acd1ef875ce3)

Other than that, the steps with removing the text are the same as [changing it](#changing-the-orange-state-warning-text).

**If the device behaves strangely, you might have made an error when editing, try to reflash the original backup of lk**
---
## Removing the 5 second delay in Orange State
**You might be annoyed by the 5-second delay that extends the boot process**
It can be deleted easily and involves the same steps as [changing the orange state warning text](#changing-the-orange-state-warning-text).

The process involves these steps:
1. **Go into your ROM backup.** If you haven't done it, [do it now](#making-a-full-backup)!
   - Find the following file: ```lk_a.bin``` or ```lk_b.bin``` **depending on which slot is active**.
   - **LK** stands for **Little Kernel** and is a kind of bootloader.
     
2. **Open the file with a hex editor** like [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
   - We will need to edit the file as hex information
     
3. **Find the needed value**
   - Do a text search for ```08B50E4B7B441B681B68022B``` in hex.
   - It should look like this:
     
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dbe2466-8fb8-4f83-8d29-98751deefcbf)
     
4. **Change the value**
   - To remove the 5 second delay, you will need to **OVERWRITE** this value.
   - The value to put in its place is ```08B5002008BD1B681B68022B```
   - They are the same lenght.
   - **MAKE SURE not to add more characters**

5. **Save the file somewhere else as lk.bin**
   - Make sure **not to overwrite your backup file!**
     
6. **Flash the file**
   - Flash the file to either ```lk_a``` or ```lk_b``` partitions **depending on which slot is active**
   - You should do the flashing the same way as in [here](#rooting) point 11.
   - Again, **make sure you only overwrite the lk_a or lk_b**.
     
7. **Reboot**
   - If you did everything correctly, it should now be fixed.
   - Now there will be no additional delay.
   - There will also be no text.
   - The boot time will be shorter by 5 seconds 🙂
   

**If the device behaves strangely, you might have made an error when editing, try to reflash the original backup of lk**

## Changing the Boot Logo

You might want to change the default boot logo that appears when you power on the phone:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f87aa0d1-f758-43ec-8cd1-1855e78e9000)

It's stored in the **logo** partition in the phone’s memory.  
*Note: The animation where the Duoqin logo swipes from the side is a different part of the boot logo process. It’s located at `/system/media/bootanimation.zip` and will be discussed later.*

The process of changing it to a premade boot logo like the ones I share is very easy. If you want to create your **own logo**, though, it will be harder.

---

### Choosing Your Process
- **If you want to just flash one of the logos I shared, go [here](#flashing-the-logo).**
- **If you want to create your own logo and flash it, continue reading.**

---

## Creating Your Own Boot Logo

### Step 1: Get Your **logo.bin**
- Obtain your **logo.bin** from your [backup](#making-a-full-backup).  
  - If you haven't done the backup yet, [do it now](#making-a-full-backup)!
- Download the [Logo Builder](https://github.com/AlikornSause/Notes-on-QIN-F21-PRO/raw/refs/heads/main/Logo/LogoBuilder_v1.6.zip) tool.
  - Unpack the ZIP file.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c24da72-ebc1-4dbe-a036-be2fba714ea2" width="300">


### Step 2: Open Logo Builder
- Run **LogoBuilder.exe**.
- Create a new project.
- Select the **logo.bin** from your original backup.
- Make a new folder somewhere and select it for the new project.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a5d209f-888a-4940-a846-b039e37454f5" width="300">


### Step 3: Adjust Image Settings
- You should now see a bunch of images.
- Click the resolution under one of the images.
- You will see something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7679e3aa-ec5d-40e9-bf72-18ce6f15fa90" width="300">


- Adjust the **size** and **bitrate**.
- Try different resolutions (right side) and bitrates (top right) until the image looks right.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d08ef701-39c9-4a63-8841-7468955bb6a0" width="300">


### Step 4: Replace Images
- Open Photoshop or GIMP.
- Create a new image **with the same resolution** as the one you want to change.
- Example:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d68f6a5b-6e08-4787-b8b0-1c895c3d1010" width="300">


- Save it in the project folder, replacing the original image **with the same name**.
- The replaced image should now look like this:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b0fa030-9a65-4aa9-8d68-afa13a3d23bc" width="300">


### Step 5: Modify All Necessary Images
- You can replace:
  - The **Duoqin logo**
  - **Charging animations**
  - **Numbers**

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter problems:
  - Ensure you have the **correct resolution**.
  - Ensure the image is saved in the **correct format**.
  - Ensure you **flashed it correctly**.
  - Try using a **different image editor**.

### Step 6: Repack the **logo.bin**
- Click this button to repack:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6475682-b4e4-4799-8961-a54e2f340c52" width="300">

- A **.zip file** will be created, but we don’t need it.
- Instead, go to the folder with the images and find the newly created **logo.bin**.
- Now, you need to flash this file!

## Flashing the Logo

You should now have the **.bin** file of the logo.\
This can either be your own logo file or one of the ones made by me.\
So far I made these:
   - [neofetch-logo.bin](https://github.com/AlikornSause/Notes-on-QIN-F21-PRO/raw/refs/heads/main/Logo/neofetch-logo.bin)
     - This contains just the boot logo.
     - If you also change the boot animation [here](#changing-the-boot-animation), it will look better, the white text will also apear, immitating kernel logs.
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b9fe88-910e-4d77-abbe-27cf7062b722" width="300">

Either way you have your logo file.

### Step 1: Prepare for Flashing
- Flash it the same way as in [rooting](#rooting).
- Use either:
  - **[mtkclient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient)**
  - **Fastboot**

### Step 2: Put Your Device into Fastboot Mode
- Enter [fastboot mode](#fastbootbootloader-mode).

### Step 3: Flash the Logo
- Run the following command:
  ```
  fastboot flash logo logo.bin
  ```
- Replace `logo.bin` with the directory to your logo file.
- Now after rebooting you should see your changes.

### If you have any bugs or problems you can always reflash the original backup logo.bin!

# Changing the Boot Animation

# Errors you can encounter
TO BE ADDED LATER

1. Bootloop when flashing patched images.
( When testing i came across this, by flashing the original vbmeta_b.bin
with a patched magisk boot_b.bin flashed. This resulted in the Orange State
warning but after 5 seconds the device just rebooted. Flash the vbmeta fix file.
)
3. Stuck after boot animation.
(I came across this when tinkering with partitions.
I wanted to see what would happen if I erased the partition **md_udc**.
By analizing the firmware it seemed that it contained userdata decryption keys.
After erasing itt, the phone was stuck at the duoqin logo after showing the bootanimation.
To fix, flash md_udc backup.
